# Application Description
This application allows a user to add and delete notes. 
Each note will have a title and body.
The user can save notes by clicking the floppy disc, and delete notes by clicking the red trashcan. 
Saved notes will be hosted on the left side of the page.
Deleted notes are gone forever, sorry.
